Hi, my name is Lorenzo and I am currently a PhD student in the Image Analysis and Learning Lab!

My current areas of interest are Instance Segmentation and Neural Networks on graphs.
But, more broadly, my scientific aim is to apply advanced and principled machine learning techniques to solve real problems (at scale!).

My favorite playground is Life science. So far I worked with neurons, [plants](https://www.plantmorphodynamics.com/) and human cells...

# More About My Interests

Time is limited, but I am also interested in:

    Dynamical System and their application to imaging and learning.
    The theoretical limits of Deep Learning (what can neural network do and what they can not?).
    Unsupervised domain adaptation and interactive learning.
    ... I could continue but I better stop!

I am not very good with languages but my python is better than my English! I am not a ninja coder but I aspire to be one.
Very recently, I discovered a new passion and her name is Julia. I am still a beginner but I am learning Julia faster than I am learning German.

My background is in Physics (bachelor in Rome Tor Vergata and master in Heidelberg). My old-time passions are chaotic dynamical systems and Statistical Mechanics.

I grew up in Italy and I lived there until I started my master's study in Heidelberg Germany.
At the risk of sounding clich√©, I really like to cook and I am strongly opinionated on food and pizza.
I love anything related to digital photography, analog photography, film developing, digital postprocessing, computational photography, vintage gear and fine art prints.
