# Lennart Bürger
I am currently working on my Master's thesis on AI Alignment in the Scientific AI lab. Previously, I studied physics in Heidelberg and Oxford and did research at the intersection of Quantum Information Theory and Machine Learning.
In Oxford I learned about the dangers unaligned AGI might pose in the near future and decided to change fields to AI Alignment. I still have a soft spot for quantum information theory (so pretty!) though. In general, I am pretty broadly interested, not only in physics, maths and computer science but also in moral philosophy and politics.
In my free time I enjoy running, meditating and cooking. I am also active in the Effective Altruism movement and the political party 'Die Grünen'.
