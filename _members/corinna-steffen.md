# Corinna Steffen

I’m currently an intern at the Scientific AI Lab and pursuing research on how neural networks can interpret chemical properties. I have a background in Physics and Chemistry, with bachelor’s theses on image analysis of cells and cluster formations of receptor channels.

From January to June, I’ll be participating in an exchange program in Finland, continuing some of my work remotely.

In my free time, I enjoy knitting and crocheting.
