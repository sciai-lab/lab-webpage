# Corinna Steffen

I’m currently writing my master's thesis at the Scientific AI Lab and pursuing research on how to improve model predictions. 
I have a background in Physics and Chemistry, with bachelor’s theses on image analysis of cells and cluster formations of receptor channels.

In my free time, I enjoy knitting and crocheting.
