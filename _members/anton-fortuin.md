# Anton Fortuin


I am currently writing my Physics Master’s thesis in the Scientific AI Lab. I previously completed my Bachelor’s thesis at Heidelberg University.

I am working on the orbital-free density functional theory project, which caught my attention because it closely aligns with my passion for machine learning and condensed matter physics.

Outside of academics, I enjoy going to the gym, playing guitar, and spending time in nature.
