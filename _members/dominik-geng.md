# Dominik Geng

I am writing my Physics Master's thesis in the Scientific AI lab. Since my Bachelor's thesis in stochastic dynamics I developed a greater interest in Theoretical Physics, Differential Geometry and Machine Learning.

Currently, I am working on Machine Learning applications to Density Functional Theory. In a broader sense, I am interested in the theoretical underpinnings of Machine Learning. That is, how can theory (Math, Physics, Chemistry, you name it) guide our understanding of Machine Learning, yielding appropriate inductive biases for model architecture. 

I studied and worked in Sport Sciences prior to my Physics education, aiming to understand, why the human body moves, develops and adapts the way it does. Writing a thesis on energy conservation in human movement sparked my theoretical interest even more leading to my eventual switching of gears and transfer to Physics. It is exactly that urge to understand the behavior of systems on a most fundamental level, that lead me from the human body to Physics and Machine Learning. <br>
My love for sports remains. Specifically, I am very engaged in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Boxing. My more gentle side is into books (old), movies (semi-old), cooking (Italian) and my dog Chewie (cute).
