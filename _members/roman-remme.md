# Roman Remme

To me, an exiting aspect of machine learning research is how great ideas can be successfully applied in countless domains, 
in particular other sciences.
As a member of the scientific AI lab, I had the chance to do so in a biological, techincal and most recently chemical context:

Currently, my main research interest is geometric machine learning, particularly its application to molecular systems.
As one of the initial members of the orbital-free DFT project, I am exited to see how the team is growing and evolving.

In my free time, I enjoy climbing and origami.
