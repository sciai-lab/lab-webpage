# Marc Ickler

I am a physics PhD student in the Scientific AI lab. Before joining the group I studied physics in Heidelberg and did my master's thesis on medical object detection. I am interested in quantum mechanics and applying neural networks to computational physics simulations. For my PhD, I am working on the orbital-free density functional theory project.

When I am not working, you might find me running or biking on the Heidelberger trails.
