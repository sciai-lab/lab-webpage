# Marc Ickler

I am a physics PhD student in the Scientific AI lab. Before joining the group I studied physics in Heidelberg and did my master's thesis on medical object detection at the German Cancer Research Center. I am interested in quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry and applying neural networks to computational physics simulations. For my PhD, I am working on the orbital-free density functional theory project, with the goal of developing a more efficient method for simulating quantum systems.

When I am not working, you might find me running or biking on Heidelberg's most beautiful trails.
