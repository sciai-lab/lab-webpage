# Enrique Fita Sanmart√≠n


I am a PhD student in Fred Hamprecht's Scientific AI lab. Previously, I studied Mathematics at the University of Valencia and Scientific Computing at Heidelberg University. I am principally interested in the development and understanding of methods for the analysis of data (specifically modelled by graphs) with a well founded theory.
