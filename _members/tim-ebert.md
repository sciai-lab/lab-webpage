# Tim Ebert


I am currently pursuing my master's degree in physics at the Scientific AI Lab. For my master's thesis, I to contribute to a team focusing on the application of equivariant machine learning models to density functional theory. This approach has the potential to accelerate quantum chemical simulations.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a passion for teaching. This semester marks my fifth term as a tutor for theoretical physics, this time for theoretical physics III.

During my leisure time, I like to engage in various sports such as tennis, bouldering, and courses offered by the uni-sports program. Additionally, I find joy in hiking and cooking.
