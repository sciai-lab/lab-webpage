# Johannes Schmidt

I am a Master student in the Scientific AI lab currently writing my Master's thesis in physics. I did a dual Bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics with a specialization on string theory and information theory. 

In my Master's thesis I am interested in machine learning architecture and theory. I am working on the density functional theory project.

In my free time I like to play ice hockey, go running or play chess. I am a huge coffee nerd, so on the weekend, you might have a high chance to meet me in a nice caf√©.
