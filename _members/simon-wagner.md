# Simon Wagner

I am currently pursuing a PhD in physics, focusing on machine learning for density functional theory.

During my master's thesis, I studied Clifford algebra representations for geometric deep learning and in particular used the gathered insights for applications in protein design. For me, machine learning for the physical sciences is one of the best ways to combine my interests in theoretical physics, mathematics, and data analysis, and I especially enjoy using mathematical methods I learned during my physics studies for applied machine learning problems in many different areas of research.

In my free time, I enjoy cycling, hiking, playing the guitar, and playing board games.
