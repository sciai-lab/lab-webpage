# Jannis Demel
I am currently doing an internship at the Scientific AI lab where I try to implement a new equivariant architecture in the Density Functional Theory (DFT) project. My previous Bachelor thesis has prepared me for this as I did it at the Institute of Theoretical Physics about DFT. In my master I started to get more interested into Machine Learning which lead to me to working for another group at university but about a topic not related to physics at all. Therefore I am now glad to be able to combine my interests in Machine Learning with my physics background.

However, I will not be in Heidelberg for the next academic year 2024/25 as I have received a scholarship to attend Cornell University during this time, where I plan on deepening my knowledge in order to come back with more technical skills.

In my freetime (which I have far too little) I like to binge watch every series I have access to, cook and go running.
