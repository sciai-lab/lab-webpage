# Jannis Demel
I am currently working on my Master’s thesis at the Scientific AI Lab, where I am part of the Orbital-Free DFT project.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) was a major focus of my Bachelor’s thesis at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, and I am very happy to now contribute to improving its scaling drastically. Since my Bachelor’s studies I have also been interested in Machine Learning and worked in a group where we applied ML to medical data. I am therefore excited to return to using similar techniques in a physical (or chemical) setting.

I have just returned from a year in the United States, where I had the opportunity to attend Cornell University. Before leaving, I completed an internship in this group focused on implementing a specific equivariant architecture, so I am especially glad to be back and continue my work.

In my free time (which I have far too little of), I enjoy binge-watching series, cooking, and running.
