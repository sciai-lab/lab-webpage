# Maria Mathews
I am currently diving into the fascinating world of hallucinations—not the trippy kind, but the quirky behaviour of Large Language Models (LLMs)—as part of my master’s thesis. My academic interests span programming, data science, machine learning, deep learning, and mathematics, fueled by a love for uncovering hidden patterns in data.
My journey into tech started early in school when my brother first had me help debug his code, but let's fast-forward to my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the College of Engineering, Trivandrum. I gained a few exciting years of experience as a software developer at Rolls-Royce and SAP, where my passion for data and machine learning truly took off.
In my downtime, you’ll likely find me trekking up a mountain (or catching my breath halfway up), exploring new cities and cuisines, or curled up with a book I pretend to finish. I’m a mindful journaler, a gym regula.. I’m also captivated by the mind’s incredible games - how it shapes the way we experience the world.
The natural world, much like networks and mind I study, is full of layers waiting to reveal its secrets. And I’m all in for the journey.
(Pretty long, huh! Told you I'm a journaler!)
