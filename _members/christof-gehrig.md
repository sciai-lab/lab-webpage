# Christof Gehrig


I am a physics master student in the Scientific AI lab. Currently, I am working on the application of equivariant machine learning methods to the problem of density functional theory.

In addition to my studies, I also serve as a Teaching Assistant for the bachelor lecture "Einf√ºhrung ins Maschinelle Lernen". This position provides me the opportunity to assist other students in their learning process, while concurrently solidifying my own understanding of the topics.

When I'm not immersed in my studies, I enjoy staying active with swimming and biking. I also participate in a student choir and enjoy playing the piano.
