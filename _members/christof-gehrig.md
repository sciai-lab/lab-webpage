# Christof Gehrig


I am a PhD student in the Scientific AI lab. Currently, I am working on the application of equivariant machine learning methods to the problem of density functional theory.

In addition to my studies, I also served as a Teaching Assistant for the lecture "Geometric Deep Learning in Quantum Chemistry". I also happen to be working on this website, so if you have any questions or requests regarding the website, please feel free to contact me.

When I'm not immersed in my studies, I enjoy staying active with swimming and biking. I also participate in a student choir and enjoy playing the piano.
