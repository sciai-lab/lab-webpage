# Sam Hewson

I am a research assistant, currently working with the charge density and optimising basis functions using ML.

I completed my Master's in Physics at Cambridge last year, and have been in Heidelberg as a research and exchange student since then. I enjoy working with ML for the sciences, and my specific interests lie in astrophysics and field theories.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy building Lego, playing the Double Bass, reading and walking (not at the same time).
