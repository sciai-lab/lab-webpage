# Yasamin Fazeli

Hi, I’m Yasamin, a Master’s student in Scientific Computing at Heidelberg University. 
I have a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, and even though I have a math background, 
I’ve always been fascinated by how machine learning can be applied to other sciences,
 which is why I’m happy to be doing an internship here at the Scientific AI Lab.

In my free time, I enjoy watching series, traveling to new places, and taking photos of the views.
