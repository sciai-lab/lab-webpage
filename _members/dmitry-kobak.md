# Dmitry Kobak

From October 2023 to March 2024 I am a visiting professor (Vertretungsprofessor) taking over Fred Hamprecht's teaching duties. I am teaching a BSc course [Einführung ins Machinelle Lernen](https://dkobak.github.io/teaching/einfuehrung-ins-ml/) and a MSc seminar [Transformers, large language models, and their use in physics](https://dkobak.github.io/teaching/transformers-llm-seminar/).

Other then that, I am a research scientist and a group leader in the [Berens lab](http://www.berenslab.org/) at Tübingen University, Germany.

I am interested in self-supervised and unsupervised learning, in particular contrastive learning, manifold learning, and dimensionality reduction for 2D visualization of scientific datasets. I am working with image data, text data, graph data, and single-cell RNA-seq data in neuroscience contexts.

Please see my personal website [https://dkobak.github.io](https://dkobak.github.io) for more details.
