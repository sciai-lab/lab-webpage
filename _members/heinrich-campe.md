# Heinrich Campe

In the Scientific AI lab, I am a PhD student working with machine learning in
quantum chemistry, specifically the DFT project. Before this, I studied
information geometry and Bayesian inference for my Masterâ€™s thesis.

Including machine learning, I am interested in algorithms in general and how
the theoretical understanding of both their objectives and inner workings may
help us improve their performance.

My free time is mostly filled with music -- I enjoy playing the piano both in
a classical and Jazz setting.
