# Heinrich Campe

In the Scientific AI lab, I am a PhD student working with machine learning in
Bayesian inference, particularly working with Markov chain Monte-Carlo methods.
Bridging the gap to theoretical physics, I'm using methods from information
geometry as well as statistical physics and thermodynamics.

Including machine learning, I am interested in algorithms in general and how
the theoretical understanding of both their objectives and inner workings may
help us improve their performance.

My free time is mostly filled with music -- I enjoy playing the piano both in
a classical and Jazz setting.
