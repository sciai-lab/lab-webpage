# Virginia Lenk

I am a master's student at the University of Heidelberg with a background in astrophysics. During my Bachelor's, I explored the connection between AGN-driven outflows and molecular gas. My research interests so far have centered around AGNs, which led me to a six-month project at ESA, where I constructed an AGN catalog using JWST observations.
 
Currently, I am involved in two research groups. In the GALENA group, I supervise two students and contribute to astrophysical projects focused on AGNs. More recently, I joined the SCAI-Lab, where I work on visualizing density estimations using Python and Blender.
 
Beyond academia, I spend my time playing (a lot of) volleyball, creating art, or reading another book by Ferdinand von Schirach.
