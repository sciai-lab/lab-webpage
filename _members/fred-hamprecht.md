Hi!

I develop machine learning algorithms for complex problems endowed with spatial structure. 

For twenty years, I had fun (and luckily some success) solving problems from image analysis. More recently, I have decided to dedicate myself entirely to the study of a long-standing problem from quantum chemistry: In the framewok of density functional theory, I try to learn the kinetic energy functional using, and expanding, the latest technology from geometric machine learning. 

What has not changed is my love for methods that have a sound mathematical background such as combinatorial optimization or algebraic graph theory, while being widely applicable and useful in practice. 

I enjoy, and feel most privileged, to be able to work on things unknown, and to teach the next generation of scientists and engineers.

I am proud that several former PhD students continue to serve in research and education, including

-    Anna Kreshuk, PI at EMBL
-    Bernhard Renard, Professor at HPI, Potsdam Universty
-    Bjoern Andres, Professor at TU Dresden
-    Bjoern Menze, Professor at Zurich University
-    Melih Kandemir , Assoc. Professor at University of Southern Denmark

Luckily, I am blessed with a fantastic lab whose members happen to be both extremely gifted and nice.
