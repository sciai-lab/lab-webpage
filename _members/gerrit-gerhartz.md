# Gerrit Gerhartz

I am a masterâ€™s student in physics and currently working in the Scientific AI lab on the DFT project.

After I wrote my bachelor's thesis in mathematical physics, where I researched the mathematical structure of the path integral in quantum mechanics, I discovered my passion for structural insight in the sciences. And what better tool to discover structures in data than machine learning?

My main interest lies in bridging the gap between the natural sciences and machine learning research, with the goal of using machine learning techniques to accelerate research and discover new facts about our physical world.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking and exploring food from all around the world. You will also find me playing video games, watching movies, and most importantly, engaging in never-ending discussions about them.
