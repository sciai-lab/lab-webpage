# Łukasz Adamowicz

Hi, I'm Łukasz. I'm a math student from Poland, currently studying in Paris and interning here, at IWR. Despite background in math, I find all physics very interesting, as well as aspects of machine learning, that have to do with goal alignment, network minimization and optimization.

In my free time I like to read books and play board games. I also like cycling and hiking. 

I used to train historical fencing (HEMA) as a hobby, so feel free to contact me if you hear anything related around Heidelberg.
