# Lukasz Adamowicz

Hi, I'm ≈Åukasz. I'm a math student from Poland, currently studying in Paris and interning here, at IWR.

In my free time I like to read books and play board games. I also like cycling and hiking. 

I used to train historical fencing(HEMA) as a hobby, so feel free to contact me if You hear anything related around Heidelberg.
