Hi, my name is Lorenzo, and I am currently a PostDoc in the sciAI lab!

My current areas of interest are Instance Segmentation, Cell Tracking, Generative AI, and Neural Networks on graphs.
But, more broadly, my scientific aim is to apply advanced and principled machine learning techniques to solve real problems (at scale!).

My favorite playground is Life science. So far, I worked with neurons, [plants](https://www.plantmorphodynamics.com/), and human cells...  

# More About My Interests

I am not very good with languages, but my Python is better than my English! I love anything related to coding and trying new, exciting programming languages! 

My background is in Physics (bachelor's in Rome Tor Vergata and master's in Heidelberg). My old-time passions are chaotic dynamical systems and statistical mechanics.

I grew up in Italy and lived there until I started my master's study in Heidelberg, Germany.

At the risk of sounding cliché, I like to cook and am strongly opinionated on food and pizza.

I love anything related to digital photography, analog photography, film development, digital postprocessing, computational photography, vintage gear, and fine art prints.
