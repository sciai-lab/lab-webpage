# Soeren Fetsch

I am a physics Bachelor's student in the Scientific AI lab. In my studies I am mostly interested
in computer physics and computer science. I am currently doing my Bachelor's thesis with the topic of spatial statistics
on the distribution of neural stem cells.

In my free time I like to cook and test out new recipes. As a contrast to the long work on the computer I love to work out or have a run in the forest.
