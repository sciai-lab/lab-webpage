# Peter Lippmann


I am a PhD student in Fred Hamprecht's Image Analysis and Learning lab. Before, I have studied Physics at Heidelberg University and at Imperial College London. My research interests range from developing principled methods to analyze structured data (let there be graphs) to more applied problems, in particular 3D computer vision.

In my free time I love doing sports, riding my bike up the Heidelberg Hills or going bouldering. I sing in a student choir and always enjoy playing the guitar in the occasional jam session. 

Feel free to get in touch with me or catch me in person at our weekly [journal club](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/ial/sem-jc) where we come together to discuss the latest and the greatest in the machine learning paper jungle.
