# Sarah Seibert

I am a Physics Master's student in the SciAI lab, currently working on the implementation of a model which combines exact and more coarse-grained regimes, in hopes of finding a sweet spot between the accuracy of DFT and the lower computational cost of classical molecular mechanics.
My studies so far have been focused on different fields of theoretical physics, where I gained a fondness for biophysics. Since learning more about Machine Learning, I have been fascinated by the possibilities which it opens up in the research on complex systems. 

When I am not working on my Master's project or attending lectures, I like to spend my time swimming and (if my joints are feeling cooperative) running. I also enjoy drawing and painting and have recently taken up sewing as a new hobby.
