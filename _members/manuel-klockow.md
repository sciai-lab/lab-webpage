# Manuel Klockow

I am currently working on my physics master thesis in the Scientific AI lab. Before going to Heidelberg, I studied physics and computer science at TU Darmstadt and FSU Jena. My research interests include machine learning and its applications in physics, which is why I am currently working on applying equivariant machine learning to density functional theory. 

In addition, I also have a deep interest in theoretical physics, which was my main focus next to machine learning during my studies. 

In my free time I enjoy playing the guitar, reading and going for long walks. If I find the time, I also like to bind books from scratch.
