# Marie Müller

I am currently pursuing my Master’s thesis in the Scientific AI Lab, where I focus on uncertainty estimation for deep neural networks.

My academic path began with a Bachelor’s degree in Meteorology and Climate Physics at KIT and continued with a Master’s in Physics at Heidelberg University. Over time, I developed a strong interest in applying statistical and machine learning methods to study and better understand complex systems, from atmospheric dynamics to molecular systems.

Outside of research, I enjoy spending time outdoors, whether hiking in the mountains or exploring new cycling routes.
