# Marie Müller

I am currently an intern in the Scientific AI Lab, focusing on uncertainty estimation in model predictions.

Beyond my internship, I am pursuing a Master’s in Physics at Heidelberg University, building on my background in Meteorology and Climate Physics. For my bachelor's thesis, titled “Equatorial waves in data-driven forecasts”, I combined my passions for Tropical Meteorology and the application of Machine Learning.

In my free time, I love exploring the outdoors, whether it is hiking or cycling.
