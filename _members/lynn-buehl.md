# Lynn Bühl

I am currently doing an internship in the Scientific AI Lab. I completed my bachelor's thesis at Heidelberg University. My research interests lie in understanding the performance differences between data augmentation and equivariant networks, with the goal of optimizing neural networks for efficiency and accuracy.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a passion for music and movement. Whether it's playing the cello or guitar or going to yoga.
