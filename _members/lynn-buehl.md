# Lynn Bühl

I am currently doing my master thesis in the Scientific AI Lab. I completed my bachelor's thesis at Heidelberg University. I'm working on extending the scope of machine-learned orbital-free DFT.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a passion for music and movement. Whether it's playing the cello or guitar or going to yoga.
