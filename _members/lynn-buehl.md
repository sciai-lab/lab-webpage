# Lynn Bühl

I am currently doing an internship in the Scientific AI Lab. I completed my bachelor's thesis at Heidelberg University. Right now, I'm working on implementing our pipeline for unrestricted DFT.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a passion for music and movement. Whether it's playing the cello or guitar or going to yoga.
