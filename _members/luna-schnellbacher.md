# Luna Schnellbacher

I am working on my physics bachelor thesis in the Scientific AI lab. The thesis project aims to use clustering techniques, to speed up training and testing models. My studies in Heidelberg and Bergen so far have focused on the computational side of physics as well as machine learning.

When I am not working on my studies, I love to spend time reading or moving through the world, hiking, biking, riding the train or most frequently running.
