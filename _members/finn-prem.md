# Finn Prem

In my current physics Bachelor's thesis at the Scientific AI lab I'm working on better understanding the loss landscapes of dimension reduction techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP.

When I have the time I enjoy physical challenges of a different kind like bouldering, dancing and mountainbiking. Afterwards, I take delight in reading or playing the piano.
